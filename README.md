At Mendeley we have one day a month that it's a "Hackday".

Every month I send a reminder. And every month the reminder contains a simple program that does:
"If today is a hackday: print 'It's a hackday!'. Else: 'It's not a hackday'"

Each monthly email is in a different programming language.

I plan to not repeat languages.

I may have to create some after a while?
